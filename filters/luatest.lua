# Lua Filter REPL Test

You can remote debug Pandoc Lua filters using [Zerobrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com)
The debugger requires luasocket and mobdebug, both are bundled in Zerobrane, or you can use
your Lua installed versions. 

## Without Lua Installed:
If you don't have Lua installed on your system, should update the environment 
search path to use mobdebug.lua and luasocket from Zerobrane's install location. 
See [documentation](https://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-remote-debugging) for details. For e.g. macOS 
this would be:

export ZBS=/Applications/ZeroBraneStudio.app/Contents/ZeroBraneStudio 
export LUA_PATH="./?.lua;$ZBS/lualibs/?/?.lua;$ZBS/lualibs/?.lua"  
export LUA_CPATH="$ZBS/bin/?.dylib;$ZBS/bin/clibs53/?.dylib;$ZBS/bin/clibs53/?/?.dylib"

## With Lua installed:
If you have installed Lua v5.3 and added mobdebug + luasocket using luarocks then 
they should be available in the default path locations (at least for POSIX systems), 
and you shouldn't need to set any path variables.

## How to Trigger the Debugger:
Ensure the filter.lua file is opened in the Zerobrane editor; Project > Start Debugger Server
is turned ON; and editor.autoactivate = true is enabled in your user.lua settings file.

Then run pandoc from terminal with the filter that is open in the editor:

> pandoc --lua-filter luatest.lua 
Here is a *test* for **REPL** debugging.
[ctrl]+[d]

Zerobrane's debugger will activate. Use the Stack window and Remote console
to examine the environment and execute Lua commands while stepping through the code.

## Commandline Use:
With mobdebug and luasocket installed, you can also debug from your teminal 
without running an IDE:

> lua -e "require('mobdebug').listen()"

But Zerobrane offers richer functionalityâ€¦
